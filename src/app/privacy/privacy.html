                <p>At Designpro.qa we collect, use and share personal data in accordance with privacy laws to make sure your data protection rights are implemented and enforced. We integrate various technical solutions to comply with applicable laws and rules related to personal data protection in countries where we operate. This Privacy Policy sets forth the basic rules and principles by which we process your personal data, and mentions our responsibilities while processing personal data.</p>
                <p>We may be a data processor or data controller according to the applicable law. Regardless of our status, we will deal with any personal data as required by any applicable regulation, including but not limited to, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (the "GDPR").</p>
                <p>We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive information from children. Our services do not aim at children. The concrete age of the children are defined differently, so any case involving a child will be reviewed individually.</p>
                <p>We understand that you are aware of and care about your own privacy interests, and we take that seriously. This Privacy Policy describes the rules and practices with regard to the collection and use of your personal data and details your privacy rights. We recognize that privacy is an ongoing responsibility, and so we will from time to time update this Privacy Policy as we undertake new personal data practices or adopt new privacy and security rules.</p>

                <h2>1. Terms We Use as Legal Guidelines of the Processing</h2>
                <p>There are some legal bases for the processing of your personal data and we count on them to process your personal data. We use the main three bases to process your personal data: consent, contract, and legitimate interest.</p>
                
                <h3>Consent</h3>
                <p>Your clear agreement to the processing of your personal data for a specific purpose.</p>
                
                <h3>Contract</h3>
                <p>The reason why the processing is necessary based on a contract you have with us, or because we have asked you to take specific steps before entering into that contract.</p>
                
                <h3>Legitimate Interests</h3>
                <p>The reason why the processing your data is necessary which is based on the legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of a third party, provided those interests are not outweighed by your rights and interests.</p>
                
                <p>Articles 6(1) and 9(2) of the GDPR also indicate other legal grounds for the processing and when applicable we will count on such grounds.</p>

                <h2>2. Consent Rule and Interrelation with Other Legal Grounds</h2>
                <p>If you have given consent to the processing of your data you can freely withdraw such consent at any time by emailing us or contacting via other available communication channels.</p>
                <p>If you do withdraw your consent, and if we do not have another legal basis for the processing of your data, then we will stop the processing of the personal data.</p>
                <p>If we have another legal basis for the processing of your data, then we may continue to do so, subject to your legal interests and rights.</p>

We act as a data controller when we determine the purposes and means of the processing of your personal data. As a data processor, we process personal data on behalf of the controller.</p>

                <p>You should read this Privacy Policy carefully. We want to make sure that you understand all your rights. It is important for both of us that you maintain your personal data confidential and secure.</p>
                <p>If you provide us with personal data about other individuals, we will only employ that data for the special reason for which it was provided to us. By sending the data, you shall be sure that you have the right to dispose to process the personal data on your behalf in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
